On paper, Team B is a group of four MCT students assigned by random chance. But after their first few meetings, this group of three Norwegians and a lone American realized that it was truly destiny that brought them together. Bringing a wide range of musical and technical expertise to the table, Team B hopes to combine their passions into something harder, better, faster, and stronger than the sum of their parts. We’re also all pretty chill guys overall. 😄

Kristian is a keyboard player from a rural area in Norway called Toten. Here, he grew up to the Soul & Rhythms of his relatives. After picking up the flute to do some 17th of May marching (Editor’s note: the Norwegian national day) in the school band, he settled for the piano. Although his beloved grandfather advised him to pursue an education in Computer Science, the attraction towards a career in music was too strong. This resulted in a Bachelor’s Degree in “Music Performance”, and add-ons including “Live Electronics: Music Technology for Performers” – before finally wrapping the pieces together in attending the MCT Master’s programme.

The last decade, he has been a freelance musician performing with acts ranging from soul and jazz via death metal to pop and hip hop. He has been a sideman for both unknown and nationally renowned artists at festivals, radio and television. The music he feels the most at home in, is the kind leaning more towards the improvised and groove-oriented.

Kristian is a father of a girl, and resides just outside of Oslo. When not performing music, he can *not* be found fly fishing in the local rivers, though he’d love to partake in an evening of board games. He is excited to get this opportunity to pursue his interests further in exploring synthesizers, music technology – and learn lots of new stuff in all things related.

Joseph is a Computer Science major from the suburbs outside of Detroit, Michigan. He became aware of music technology during his bachelor’s at the University of Michigan and, after two years of work in vehicle emission testing, decided to continue pursuing this field in his professional career through the MCT program. He’s excited to learn more about the field and to combine his technical knowledge with new musical skills learned in the program. He also likes to think he’s a pretty fun guy despite this stone cold, paint-by-numbers bio he just wrote.



## Jakob Høydal

Jakob is a bass player and audio-engineer born in the small town of Langevåg on the west-coast of Norway. At a young age he started in the local marching-band. In his teens he figured that rock was a lot more fun. He couldn’t bring his trombone to the band, so he started to play bass. He also played the double bass for a few years, but sold it so he could travel.

In later years Jakob studied music production at Kristiania University College. He also freelance at the technical side of concert venues and in the broadcast-scene.

Jakob looks forward to learning a lot about how things connect, and to expand his knowledge about technology in the music- and audio-field.

Arvid Falch is a Norwegian music composer. He spent his formative years recording and touring with various acts and artists, until he got tired of carrying heavy amps into yet another basement club. Since then he has worked as a composer and music supervisor. He has composed music for a variety of films, TV series, apps, shorts and commercials.
Musically Arvid has steered more towards the classical world in the later years, but he still hangs out with his old band mates jamming with synths and guitars whenever he's able.

Arvid is a father of two children and resides just outside Oslo, Norway. When not making music he can be found fly fishing in the local rivers or playing tabletop roleplaying games with his friends.

Joining the MCT program, Arvid is really looking forward to explore technology which could be used in post production environments and creative musical collaborations across borders.

Team B seems to be a pretty homogeneous group regarding the personal characteristics. Taking turns and stating our characteristics oftentimes resulted in agreement and appreciative nods from fellow members. We might just be a curious bunch of empathic team players keeping it cool – luckily with one of us willing to be a leader in a pinch. 👌 In stating the practical skills, Team B realized that they’re actually already a band according to the instruments covered. The technological knowledge appears to be diverse, sporting a software developer alongside audio engineers and music theorists.



## Conclusion

After a week with a lot of new experiences, we are all looking forward to making, creating and working with music technology. As a group of people with different backgrounds, experiences and workflows, we can't wait to share and learn from each other.
