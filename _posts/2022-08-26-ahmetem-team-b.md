<p align="justify"> As the first week of MCT came to a close, we had the opportunity to introduce ourselves and get to know our teams, with whom we will work until the end of the semester. Team B is made up of three enthusiastic individuals who share a common interest–a love for music and technology. During our first conversation we established our ground rules as we all agreed that working together can help us perform better. As a result, we promised to facilitate cooperation through our engagement and communication. We hope to improve our overall performance and productivity by providing authenticity and uniqueness. As we are a diverse group of people with very different cultural and professional backgrounds, combining our strengths can help to boost our creativity while also minimizing our individual weaknesses. In this case, the strengths and weaknesses of our team members can complement and enhance one another. We believe that we must work together in harmony to create a positive experience. Furthermore, as a team, we want to encourage specialization and industry knowledge. Therefore, we strive to build and develop competencies that will serve us and those around us for the rest of our lives. Moreover, we acknowledge the responsibilities of working and performing as a group. Each team member is responsible for the team's success. Lastly, we intend to encourage and support one another in order to overcome all future obstacles and chart a clear path to success.</p>

### Endri Alickaj

<p align="justify"> Endri is the new MCT student. Recently, he graduated from NHH with a master's degree in business and now pursuing his musical passion at UIO. Endri has been making music since he was a teenager, and this time he wants to use his skills and knowledge to help society innovate. Currently, he is interested in the psycho-emotional aspects of music and how they affect humans and their well-being. Because technology is advancing at such a rapid pace, Endri believes that we should strive to build a deep neural network capable of producing high-quality music with both harmony and melody that is comparable to music composed by humans. Furthermore, by utilizing technology such as deep learning or motion capture, we can create phenomenal artistic scenes that will entertain and stick with people for a very long time.</p>

### Emin Memis

<p align="justify"> Emin is a creative tech guy who is into creating new things using machines. After studying computer science, learning music and working on research on these, he is ready to combine everything he has to do fantastic things at MCT! His interests range from music, media, motion and visual arts to data science, algorithms and programming. He worked on AI-music and psychology-related research. Whether it was creating classical piano music using AI or seeking answers to behavioral questions about music, these experiences made him want to go deep into music and its complex structure. Besides that, he loves cats, classical music and creating videos and photographs.</p>

### Nino Jakeli

<p align="justify"> Nino has a background in jazz and business. She studied jazz vocal performance at the conservatory. There, she began leaning more towards experimental music production. She is currently interested in collecting samples which she cuts, edits and arranges in many different ways. Another dimension she aims to explore during the MCT programme is silence and its impact on music perception. Beyond that, her subject of study incorporates music and machine learning, music psychology and sound exploration. She looks at this programme as an exciting journey for picking up the unique skills and experiences that MCT provides. During her free time, she immensely tries to take ice baths and practice martial arts.</p>
