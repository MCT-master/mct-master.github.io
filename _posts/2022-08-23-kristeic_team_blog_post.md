Our interests span classical music, film music, human-computer interaction, and much more. We are all musicians who developed a love for technology, and are looking forward to creating all sorts of wild and wacky musical tools over the next two years.

I am a musician and technology enthusiast from Dresden, Germany. I originally started as a guitarist in bands and eventually found myself interested in more technology-driven fields of producing and recording music while finishing my Bachelor in Musicology in 2022. I see myself as a tech humanist and a knowledge hungry musician who is never too shy to dive into new territory. Besides being a student, I take joy in developing new ideas for weird instruments, listening to obscure metal and petting every cat I see on the way.

Christian Thobroe Anda is a film/tv/game composer (or at least trying to be). He has a bachelor degree in film music from Leeds College of Music, took a “year course” (Årsstudium) in art history, and just finished a postgraduate certificate in education. Christian is a multi-instrumentalist, mainly focusing on guitar and piano

His interests, and reason for attending MCT, is to learn more about audio interactivity, and how to compose and use music to make people feel. While also feeding his addiction for new and old technologies that can change the ways of composing, interacting and perceiving music.

Jack is a violinist and computer musician from Mirfield, a small town between Manchester and Leeds in northern England. He’s played the violin for 18 years (a realisation which has made him feel old) and has a BA in Music from Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, USA, where he discovered his love for electro-acoustic composition and technologically extended violin performance, as well as film and video art.

After spending the last few years working in arts marketing for theatre and opera on both sides of the Atlantic, he’s looking forward to continuing to explore his passion for all things MCT, particularly human-computer interaction and instrument design.

Outside of music he can be found watching Formula 1, thinking he’s Gordon Ramsay while cooking questionable food, or playing strategy and simulation video games.
