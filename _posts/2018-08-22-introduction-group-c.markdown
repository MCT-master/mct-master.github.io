excerpt: "We are an international group of students with different background in
humanities, programming, music and music production based in Oslo and
Trondheim. Even though we just got together without knowing each other
from before we are excited to work together and face new challenges. We
are interested in finding new ways to combine different technologies and
media to solve societal problems. We are going to make this happen by
sharing knowledge within the group and use each other’s strengths. We
think our biggest challenge is that we are placed in to different cities
and not possible to meet physically."

We are an international group of students with different background in
humanities, programming, music and music production based in Oslo and
Trondheim. Even though we just got together without knowing each other
from before we are excited to work together and face new challenges. We
are interested in finding new ways to combine different technologies and
media to solve societal problems. We are going to make this happen by
sharing knowledge within the group and use each other’s strengths. We
think our biggest challenge is that we are placed in to different cities
and not possible to meet physically.

With the technologies available to us, we are looking forward to
challenge the distance between the campuses and improve even upon our
workspace. We are happy to be part in this cutting edge project from
which we can learn a lot and contribute with new knowledge, methods and
tools.

## Bio

**Karolina**: With a background in media-film and theatre studies I
landed in the MCT program to learn about hand-on technology and its
societal implications in the field of music. I worked in web-, as well
as in video- and film production.  I have experience in audio-visual
editing and web-design.

**Elias**: When I was 14/15 years old I found interest in playing drums.
I soon after started in a band. Since 2012 I have been a part of a rock
community called Akkerhaugen Rocksamfunn. I also have a bachelor degree
in informatics and have some experience with DJing.

**Jonas**: I’m a 23 year old guitarist from Bergen, Norway. With ten
years of experience with performance, songwriting and music production I
recently completed a bachelor degree in music technology. The bachelor
thesis was based upon sound design and implementation of audio in
different applications in virtual reality, which is the field I want to
specialize in.
