# Preparing the portal for Entrepreneurship presentation

Our portal has been suffering from both audial and visual issues since the beginning of the MCT program. 
We solve one problem and the next is just waiting in line to show itself. **NOW**, we all had an exam
just around the corner, an exam where we were going to hold a presentation in the portal across
campuses. **The importance of a working portal now felt very crucial!** With this in mind we started
working on visability, audibility and reliability.

Because of TICO's supperior video quality over Zoom, we decided together with Ben Tocher, the teacher in
the entrepreneurship course, to make it our primary video source. **BUT**, since the TICO system is very
unreliable we had to have a backup system, which was Zoom. In case TICO would go crazy - turning off
for a long period of time or displaying all the colors of the rainbow, it had to be a quick way of 
changing video source to Zoom.

In short, the setup ended up being:

* Panasonic (large screen) as computer _primary screen_, **used for control over pc and presentation material**
* Sony (smaller screen) as computer _extended screen_, **used for displaying video from either TICO or Zoom, depending on input source**
* Audio running through Zoom
